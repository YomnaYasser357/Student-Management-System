# Student Management System (C++ â€“ OOP & Data Structures)

## Overview
The **Student Management System** is a simple yet professional application built in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and Data Structures. It provides functionalities to manage student records efficiently, including adding, updating, deleting, searching, sorting, and displaying student details.

## Features
- **Add Student**: Store student details including ID, Name, and GPA.
- **Remove Student**: Delete a student record based on ID.
- **Update Student**: Modify student details.
- **Display All Students**: Show all stored student records.
- **Search Student**: Find a student by ID.
- **Sort Students by GPA**: Arrange students in descending order based on GPA.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**
- **STL (Standard Template Library)** for vector and algorithm operations.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as encapsulation and abstraction.

## Installation & Execution
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):
   ```bash
   g++ student_management.cpp -o student_management
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./student_management
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Choose an option from the menu:
   - `1`: Add a student.
   - `2`: Remove a student.
   - `3`: Update student details.
   - `4`: Display all students.
   - `5`: Search for a student.
   - `6`: Sort students by GPA.
   - `7`: Exit the program.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input details.

## Example Usage
```
1. Add Student
Enter ID, Name, GPA: 101 John 3.8
Student added successfully!

4. Display All Students
ID: 101, Name: John, GPA: 3.8
```

## Future Enhancements
- Implement file handling to save and load student data.
- Add a GUI for better user experience.
- Improve search functionality with more filters.
